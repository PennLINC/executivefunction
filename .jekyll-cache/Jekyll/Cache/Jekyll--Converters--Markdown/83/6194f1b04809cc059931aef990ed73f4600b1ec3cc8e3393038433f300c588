<p>In order to collect passive data, some machine in the cloud needs to be running constantly and minimally preprocessing it for storage. This is where Amazon’s EC2 product comes in. EC2 stands for <em>Elastic Compute Cloud</em> and is one of Amazon’s many AWS products.</p>

<p>Put simply, an <em>EC2 instance</em> is a virtual server in the cloud for running applications on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure. This means it can run in the background and be accessed via the internet. For our purposes, the EC2 instance connects to AWARE and manages the running of the <em>AWARE dashboard</em>.</p>

<h2 id="set-up">Set Up</h2>
<p>To set up an EC2 instance, the lab will need an Amazon Web Services account. This can be set up by the PI (who will likely reach out to IT and the program manager) and once this is configured, you’ll be able to log in to AWS and see a page similar to the one below:</p>

<p>Once this is complete, you’ll need to set up an instance. These instances are somewhat like Docker images, in that they can be deployed on individual machines in a containerized way, and they can be shared. Fortunately for us, we were able to have a pre-configured instance <em>cloned</em> to our AWS for us to use. If you don’t have this option, you’ll need to build the instance yourself. There are instructions for how to do that in <a href="https://pennlinc.github.io/MobilePheno_AwareInfra_docs/assets/Aware_Dashboard_Install_Instructions_Ubuntu_18.pdf">this document</a>.</p>

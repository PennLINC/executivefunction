<p>This is projected to be a 5-year study, with start date contingent upon IRB approval and an end date of July 1, 2023. All participants will be assessed and imaged twice, however, participants who enroll in the first half of the project period will be able to complete a third session. Thus, participants will be assessed and scanned 2 to 3 times over 5 years in order to observe executive function during a critical period of ongoing brain development (childhood and adolescence). Participants will be assessed using a detailed diagnostic interview and computerized neurocognitive battery, identical to the ones used by protocol #813943 and LiBI, and self-report scales. We will use longitudinal change in imaging data to predict EF across groups. The Diagnostic Interview and Computerized Neurocognitive Battery will be done through the LiBI protocol (CHOP IRB  #16-013305) and participants will thus sign the consent forms associated with these protocols (see attached for review).  We will be collecting consent and administering a portion of study procedures electronically, over the phone, or using BlueJeans or similar HIPAA-compliant, IRB and University approved teleconferencing systems.</p>

<p>If participants have received a clinical assessment via another lab protocol (e.g., IRB #813943, CHOP IRB  #16-013305) within 1 month of their imaging visit, we may not repeat the clinical assessment and we will only have them come in for the imaging visit at that time point. For those research subjects who have provided consent to be re-contacted and have expressed a continued desire to participate in future research studies, coordinators across the Center may utilize the database to recruit these individuals for a new study. Coordinators receive database access only through PI approval and after completed training with the data core. As described in the Neuropsychiatry Sectionâ€™s center-wide protocol (#813943), and LiBIâ€™s protocol (CHOP IRB  #16-013305), the department database is encrypted and password protected.  Should a subject indicate he/she is no longer interested in volunteering for research studies his/her study ID is labeled as non-active.  This non-active field will prevent non-active study IDâ€™s from appearing in database queries and also prevent inadvertent contact by future coordinators.</p>

<h1 id="recruitment">Recruitment</h1>
<p>Participants will be recruited using screening mechanisms provided by LiBI (CHOP IRB  #16-013305), a research institute that spans both CHOP and Penn.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Target: 180 adolescents, including 65 with ADHD and 65 with PS, as well as 50 typically-developing comparators</li>
  <li>Patients (n=126 total) will be drawn from two clinical groups with well-documented executive deficits: ADHD and PS (n=63 per group).  Both patient groups and typically-developing comparators (n=49) will be matched on age, sex, and race.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Key Inclusion Criteria</em>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Age: 8-15 (18 by completion of study)</li>
  <li>Sex: Males and Females</li>
  <li><em>Patients (n=130)</em>: 
  -Each participant will meet diagnostic criteria for either ADHD or PS (see Assessment, below).  Given known and substantial co-morbidity between PS and ADHD (i.e., approx. 30% in the PNC), co-morbidity will be allowed and accounted for in specificity analyses. Youth meeting criteria for both PS and ADHD will be considered PS for enrollment purposes.</li>
  <li><em>Typically developing (n=50)</em>:
    <ul>
      <li>No current or lifetime history of any DSM-V diagnosis or substance use disorder.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Proficiency in English</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Key Exclusion Criteria</em>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Significant medical or neurological illness that may increase risk.</li>
  <li>Pregnancy</li>
  <li>Any history of pervasive developmental disorder or intellectual disability</li>
  <li>Documented history of a psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, or clinically significant current substance misuse</li>
  <li>Non-psychiatric medical disorders that may impact brain function or visual acuity</li>
  <li>Lack of a mobile device with capabilities to complete study procedures</li>
  <li>Acute intoxication with alcohol or other substances based on clinical assessment, subject report, or results of laboratory testing</li>
  <li>For 3T and 7T participants only: contraindications/claustrophobia</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="procedure">Procedure</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Participants will perform self-report questionnaires, a neurocognitive battery assessment and both passive and active mobile data collection on the custom-built AWARE App.</li>
  <li>After consent, participants will be asked to complete a neurocognitive battery online, as well as self-report questionnaires and a computerized adaptive clinical interview.</li>
  <li>Participants will also be directed to download the AWARE app. There will be 2, 2-week periods of active survey collection 3 times per day, and passive data collection using the AWARE app for 6 months. EMA questions from the app will include questions related to mood, behavior, sleep, or other aspects pertaining to participantsâ€™ daily lives.</li>
  <li>In addition to survey data, AWARE will passively collect information pertaining to accelerometer data, GPS data, phone call and text messaging meta-data, all key-stroke data (with the exception of passwords), and phone/screen usage data.</li>
  <li>A subsample of (500) participants will be brought in for imaging procedures.  Imaging visits will last approximately 2-3  hours and will be conducted at Penn/CHOP.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="compensation">Compensation</h1>
<p><em>Participants will be reimbursed for travel (transportation and parking) expenses incurred on scan day.</em>
<em>All participants will be paid virtually using Venmo or PayPal applications.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Payment for virtual participation:
    <ul>
      <li>AWARE surveys:Subjects will receive $1 per survey they complete during each of the 2 weeks, with a $3 bonus for completing more than 75% of the surveys (up to $24/week.) Subjects will be paid $3 for each month of passive data collection (detailed below) for 6 months (up to $18).</li>
      <li>Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (1 hour): Subjects performing cognitive testing with the standard Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB) applied routinely in the Brain Behavior Laboratory will be paid $20.</li>
      <li>Self-Report Measures: (1 hour): Subjects will be compensated $10 for completion of proposed surveys assessments.</li>
      <li><strong>Total compensation possible: $144 over 6 months</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Assessments of Decision-making, Reward, Motivation, and Sociability  (1 hour): $40</li>
  <li>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (1 hour): $60</li>
</ul>

    "content": "# The AWARE Framework --- AWARE is a framework dedicated to instrument, infer, log and share mobile context information by sensor instrumentation, for application developers, researchers and smartphone users. AWARE captures hardware-, software-, and human-based data from smartphones. The data is then analyzed using AWARE plugins. They transform data into information you can understand. - AWARE framework website . --- In short, AWARE is a software suite that handles the collection of mobile data. It was developed by the World Well-Being Project, of which UPenn is a collaborator with Lyle Unghar. If you want to set up a mobile phenotyping project at UPenn, their group is who to reach out to. AWARE presents to participants (users) as a mobile app that can be installed on participants’ devices by sharing a URL. Once installed, the app monitors different data streams depending on what the _study_ has configured. ## Studies & The AWARE Dashboard Studies are configured by developers in the lab. Once you’ve approved a project with WWBP, they will set up an AWARE _site_ for you. This will be the management home of your project that you can access online — the _AWARE Dashboard_. In our case, the URL we were able to visit for managing studies is https://aware-dev2.wwbp.org/index.php/. Once your site is online, you may sign in with (in our case) a Google account, which will take you to this landing page: ## Creating Study To get started, click `Create Study`. You’ll be directed to this page: Fill in the relevant details, and for the `Study Database` select `This server` (we’ll talk more about servers in the Amazon EC2 section, but this basically means that whatever _site_ was configured for your use will send its data to the machine created for you). From here, the study will be available as below: ## Configuring Studies At this point, you will likely want to figure out how to add data streams to collect. To add a data stream, simply click the `Edit sampling` button on the right, and click the data type you’d like to collect. Click the toggle button to activate data collection on the sensor for that data type, and manipulate the sampling (how many times per interval the app grabs data). In this example, we’ll collect a couple of different streams, including accelerometer, battery, texts, communication contexts, location, and screen time! For a look at all of the available data streams and descriptions of what they are/do, see AWARE's sensor documentation. ## Adding Participant Devices Now you have a study, and you know what data you want to collect in it. To add participants to the study, have them download the AWARE_V2 application first. In iOS, it comes up first in the App Store as AWARE_V2: Now, simply share the URL available under `Join study`, or allow users to scan the QR code. Users can find the QR code scanner under `Settings` in the top right hand corner: Whenever a user has a problem on their device, they may just need to re-sync with the server. To do this, they can click the sync arrows in the top right. ## Collecting Active Data Once a user has gone through the above, the mobile device will begin collecting passive data at whatever sampling rate you configured. But if you wanted to collect _active_ data (e.g., have users answer a question or respond to a survey), you’ll need to configure an ESM. Once any number of devices are connected, you’ll notice a change to the bottom of the screen of the AWARE Dashboard. From here, you can configure an ESM to go out to users: ",

    "title": "Amazon EC2",
    "content": "# Amazon EC2 Instances In order to collect passive data, some machine in the cloud needs to be running constantly and minimally preprocessing it for storage. This is where Amazon’s EC2 product comes in. EC2 stands for _Elastic Compute Cloud_ and is one of Amazon’s many AWS products. Put simply, an _EC2 instance_ is a virtual server in the cloud for running applications on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure. This means it can run in the background and be accessed via the internet. For our purposes, the EC2 instance connects to AWARE and manages the running of the _AWARE dashboard_. ## Set Up To set up an EC2 instance, the lab will need an Amazon Web Services account. This can be set up by the PI (who will likely reach out to IT and the program manager) and once this is configured, you’ll be able to log in to AWS and see a page similar to the one below: Once this is complete, you’ll need to set up an instance. These instances are somewhat like Docker images, in that they can be deployed on individual machines in a containerized way, and they can be shared. Fortunately for us, we were able to have a pre-configured instance _cloned_ to our AWS for us to use. If you don’t have this option, you’ll need to build the instance yourself. There are instructions for how to do that in this document. ",

For this project, we want to use data collected from people’s mobile devices to learn more about affect, mood, the brain, and behaviour. To accomplish this, we need some way to both passively and actively collect data from their phones safely, efficiently, and with their permission. We already have a very fruitful example of how this can be done and what we can learn, from Cedric Xia’s 2021 publication. The solution for this project was initially developed by Lyle Unghar’s group at the University of Pennsylvania. Much of this project borrows their infrastructure, and so this documentation serves as a replication guide for how to set up the software architecture for a mobile phenotyping project. The components are as follows: 1. The AWARE Framework 2. An accompanying Amazon EC2 Instance 3. An accompanying AWARE backend server 4. Your local data analysis framework and RAPIDS ",

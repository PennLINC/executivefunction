# Mobile Phenomics Documentation

The study of mood and anxiety disorders greatly relies on the use of retrospective mood interviews to measure affective instability as well as other symptoms and behaviors. The present study seeks to more accurately measure affective instability using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and other data collected from participant smart-phones. This data will be used to better characterize mood lability across psychiatric diagnoses, as well as to relate these patterns of behavior to multi-modal network based imaging measures.

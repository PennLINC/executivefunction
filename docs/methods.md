# Study Measures

## Daily Activity Tracking and Monitoring
- Questionnaires similar to those approved in IRB protocol #813943 
- GPS Data
- Accelerometer/activity data
- Sociability metadata and phone keystroke data
- Overall phone/screen usage

## Cognitive Assessment
- WebCNP Cognitive Battery approved in IRB protocol #813943

## Self Report Questionnaires
Measures approved in lab-wide protocols, including but not limited to:
- Affective Reactivity Index (ARI)
- Beck Depression Index II (BDI)
- Adverse Childhood Experiences scale (ACES)
- Behavioral Inhibition/Activation Scales (BIS/BAS) 
- Brief Sensation Seeking Scale (BSS)
- The Chapman Trait Anhedonia Scales for physical (RPAS) and social (RSAS) anhedonia
- Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)
- Other standard psychological scales may be administered as well

## Imaging Procedures
All imaging procedures will be approved by CAMRIS. The imaging measures collected in this study will not make use of IV contrast agents. 

3T Imaging Procedures similar to those approved in IRB protocols #828424, #822831:
- High-resolution Anatomical Images
- Resting Perfusion Images
- Functional Images
- Diffusion Images
- Other experimental imaging sequences that may not be FDA-approved but are considered non-significant risks

7T Imaging Procedures similar to those approved in IRB protocol #825834:
- Magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) resulting in a T1-weighted contrast image 
- Spoiled gradient echo (GRE) resulting in a T2*-weighted contrast images
- Turbo spin echo (TSE) sequence resulting in T2-weighted contrast
- fMRI BOLD activation to a white cross-hair
- Single-shot echo planar imaging (EPI) 
- GluCEST imaging parameters 
- Other experimental imaging sequences that may not be FDA-approved but are considered non-significant risks
